### Hello :)

ğŸ”– Iâ€™m a young independent developer based in *Reading Massachusetts*. I specialize in **front-end development**, with a concentration in **App UI, UX, and system modeling**, but have worked with **low-level hardware/software interaction, relational / reactionary Database management, game engines, and data visualization** throughout the past 6 years.

#### **Iâ€™m currently working on**

*Recall* - A calendar based app designed around recording daily events to be able to view trends in productivity, goal completion, and time management over time. It is built natively in swift and swiftUI on the front end, and uses MongoDB and Realm DeviceSync on the backend.

*Cactus* - A social media platform centered around climate solutions and innovations. It connects individuals with buisnesses and organizations who are working towards individual climate goals or looking for fundraising for sustainable development to mobilize and excite the general public around climate action.

*Echeveria* - A social platform designed around recording game statistics. Users create social groups to share their personal and collective game dataâ€”wins, losses, winstreaks, time spent playing gamesâ€”with their friends. It is built with swift + swiftUI for front end, and MonngoDB + Realm DeviceSync for back end.

#### **Iâ€™m currently learning**
	- Machine Learning models for generating habitual study patterns
	- New design Patterns for quick and secure data storage and retrieval
	- Optimized buffer techniques for offloading work to GPU (a)syncrhonously
	- Linear algebra based 3D graphics optimization 

#### **Iâ€™m interested in**
	- The climate crisis, and ways that patterned thinking and computer science tools can be used to create systems of information, support, and pressure to simultaneously relieve disadvantaged communities suffering from global warming, and push climate action forward in nuanced and systemic ways. 
	- The role of human programmers as intellects and artists in the contemporary computer science industry, especially with the emergence of AI generated code, frameworks, and programs. 
	- The emerging economic strategies and management behind manufacturing and delivering software products as a buisness

#### **Contact**
Im always looking to collaborate with new people, organizations, and companies, so please reach out with opportunities, projects you're working on, or just to chat :)
