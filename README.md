### Hello :)

ðŸ”– Iâ€™m a young independent developer based in *Reading Massachusetts*. I specialize in **front-end development**, with a concentration in **App UI, UX, and system modeling**, but have worked with **low-level hardware/software interaction, relational / reactionary Database management, game engines, and data visualization** throughout the past 5 years.

#### **Iâ€™m currently working on**
	- An AI powered study app aimed at making intelligent study features, including study routining, memorization strategies, and organizational suggestions accessible to students without immediate access to teachers, tutors, or private support programs.
	- A MAcOS Graphics Renderer, written in C, aimed at optimizing performance and lighting simulation for object files

#### **Iâ€™m currently learning**
	- Machine Learning models for generating habitual study patterns
	- New design Patterns for quick and secure data storage and retrieval
	- Optimized buffer techniques for offloading work to GPU (a)syncrhonously
	- Linear algebra based 3D graphics optimization 

#### **Iâ€™m interested in**
	- The climate crisis, and ways that patterned thinking and computer science tools can be used to create systems of information, support, and pressure to simultaneously relieve disadvantaged communities suffering from global warming, and push climate action forward in nuanced and systemic ways. 
	- The role of human programmers as intellects and artists in the contemporary computer science industry, especially with the emergence of AI generated code, frameworks, and programs. 
	- The emerging economic strategies and management behind manufacturing and delivering software products as a buisness

Iâ€™m always looking for more time to spend coding, whether that be in a professional context or on my own, so reach out if youâ€™re interested in collaborating on any projects!

Pinned below are all my published projects.
